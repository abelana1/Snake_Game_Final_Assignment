# Snake_Game_Final_Assignment
Here you can find the code for the Final Assignment of the Pyladies course. The idea is to program a snake game where the user provides as input the length and location of the snake, the size of the grid, the location of the fruit and then in an interactive way it can move the snake with 4 different movements: north, south, east and west. 
When the snake eats the fruit then it expands in size (therefore, in length).
The game finishes when the user enters end.
